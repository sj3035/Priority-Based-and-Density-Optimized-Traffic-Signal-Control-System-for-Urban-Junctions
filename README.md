# Priority-Based-and-Density-Optimized-Traffic-Signal-Control-System-for-Urban-Junctions
This project presents a Priority-Based and Density-Optimized Traffic Signal Control System designed to address urban traffic congestion and emergency vehicle delays using intelligent, real-time decision-making. Leveraging a combination of infrared sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and RFID modules, the system accurately estimates vehicle density and detects approaching emergency vehicles. A Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning model, trained in the SUMO traffic simulator, dynamically adjusts green light durations to minimize average waiting time and maximize throughput. The model is deployed on a Jetson Nano for edge inference, while an Arduino UNO handles hardware-level control of simulated traffic lights. The system has been validated through both simulation and a physical miniature prototype, demonstrating significant improvements in traffic flow, reduced congestion, and rapid emergency response facilitation. This project contributes to smart city development by offering an adaptive, scalable, and cost-effective solution for intelligent transportation systems (ITS).
